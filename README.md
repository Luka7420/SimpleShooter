🎯 **Simple Shooter – UE5 C++ Project**

A third-person shooter I built in Unreal Engine 5 using C++.

I worked on:

⚡ Designing smooth player movement and custom animations

🔫 Building a shooting system with particles, effects, and gun logic

🤖 Creating enemy AI with behavior trees and custom C++ nodes

❤️ Implementing health, damage, and death for both player and AI

🏆 Setting up win/lose conditions through game mode logic
